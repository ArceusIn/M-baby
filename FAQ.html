        <h4>A knowledge base with the most common issues and questions about transferring your files with ToffeeShare,
            and file sharing in general.</h4>

            <h1>üöÇWhy peer to peer?</h1>
            <h2>
                Peer to peer communication means the communication flows directly between two devices rather than via an
                intermediate server. This means your data will not be stored somewhere else before it reaches its
                destination. ToffeeShare achieves this via WebRTC, a relatively new communication API used in modern
                browsers. Under the hood of WebRTC is a protocol called STUN.</h2>






            <h2>As the image above illustrates this also allows for a much higher transfer speed. Simply because you
                completely skip the whole upload to a server
                <br>
                What might be interesting to know is that ToffeeShare initially started out as a native application,
                running our own proprietary version of the STUN protocol. When we discovered this had also become
                possible within the browser we decided to focus on that first. We might still launch the native version
                in the near future, but this is currently not a priority. Feel free to contact us about it, so we can
                give you a demo.

            <h1> üîêWhy end to end encryption?</h1>
            <h2>With basic encryption your data is made incomprehensible to make sure nobody can listen in when you‚Äôre
                connected with a server. This is safe in most cases, but if for whatever reason a server is compromised
                or or hacked, the privacy of your data is in jeopardy. End to end encryption solves this problem by
                leaving out the man in the middle. Instead of on the server, encryption will be done directly between
                the sender and receiver.
                <br>
                <br>
                Nowadays more and more services that take security in mind adopt this idea. The downside is that both
                parties have to be online at the same time in order to make the required agreement to make end to end
                encryption possible. And of course there are the services that have other reasons for sticking as man in
                the middle.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are many different ways of making end to end encryption possible, but ToffeeShare uses the default
                WebRTC implementation, which currently is DTLS v1.2, an industry standard. The encryption will
                automatically update when your browser does, so you are always sure to have the latest version running
                (as long as you keep your browser up-to-date of course).

            <h1> üìÅHow can I send multiple files with the same link?</h1>
            <h2>Just select multiple files like you normally would browsing your computer or mobile device. The received
                will be notified you're trying to send multiple files and can see the total file size.</h2>

            <h1>‚åõIt starts downloading but crashes at 100% (or before)</h1>
            <h2>Some browsers do not support directly downloading to your download folder. Safari is known to have this
                issue. As a fallback we have to save the entire file in memory, which may cause some strange and
                unexpected result when downloading large files (3/4GB+). Sometimes it might crash the browser tab or in
                very rare cases even the entire web browser(!).
                <br>
                <br>
                That's why we advice you to use either Chrome, Firefox or a modern version of Edge. These browsers allow
                us to download straight to your computer so don't have this issue.

            <h1>üï∞It keeps saying: could not connect to sender</h1>
            <h2>ToffeeShare requires the sender to be online in order to establish a peer to peer connection. If the
                sender is offline or has closed the browser tab containing the files, the files are simply no longer
                available. Please ask the sender if he can send you another link.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the sender still has the browser tab open, but uses a mobile phone, ask them to reopen the web
                browser with ToffeeShare open. Some mobile browsers will go into hibernation when the phone is put to
                standby or another app is opened.

            <h2>ToffeeShare has been tested on many different networks, but we can't guarantee that it will work
                everywhere. If the progress bar is stuck at 0% it usually means a connection cannot be made. When
                sharing from a mobile phone you could try to switch from a mobile network to WiFi. If it feels like
                something is not working as it should please send us a message.</h2>

                downloading, but not being saved. What usually helps is to just restart the transfer, you should see
